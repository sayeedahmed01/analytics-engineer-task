Hi,

I have completed my initial analysis of the data and wanted to share a few findings and see if you could help me answer a few questions.

Starting with the brands data:
- I noticed duplications in the ‘brandCode’ for brands like GOODNITES and HUGGIES, along with several missing values. Do you happen to have any insight into why this might be happening?
- How should we handle cases where there are multiple entries for the same brand code? Should we drop all duplicates or is there a preferred method to identify the correct brand code?
- Do you know what data source the ‘cpg_id’ is referring to? Would including this in our data model be useful for future requirements?

Regarding the receipts data:
- There are some receipts where the ‘purchaseDate’ occurs after the ‘createDate’. Is there a specific business logic for this that I should be aware of?
- Additionally, the metabriteCampaign field which seems to track metrics for certain campaigns or promo events, should we keep this field for long-term analysis?

For the users data, I found some duplications in user IDs and some test IDs mixed in. I’ll be reaching out to the dev team to clarify these.

Lastly, as our data grows, I want to ensure we maintain good performance and scalability.
- How often will aggregate data be queried or are there any specific timeframes we should focus on for reporting purposes?
- It would be helpful to know about any data queries that are expected to be made available on a frequent basis.

This information will help me set up efficient partitions and create views for frequent data queries.

Happy to schedule a call to walk you through the issues.

Thanks,
Sayeed
